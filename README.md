# CRWN-CLOTHING implementation of Context API

This repo is a fork of the [Complete React Developer](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery) instructor's repo from an earlier milestone in the course, at a point in which Redux was implemented but not Thunks or Redux Saga.

The instructor reverted to this point in the course to teach React's Context API. Thus the commits in this repo will reflect implementation of Context and removal of Redux and associated libraries. 

This repo is not my main implementation of the course's main project; therefore, I have not deployed this repo to Heroku, but feel free to look over my code changes via the commits. 

You can view my main implementation of this project (which **is** deployed to Heroku) in this repo:
